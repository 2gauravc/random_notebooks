This git repository is a collection if various random project notebooks. These notebooks may come from: 

- LinkedIn experiments done by others 
- Sources like AWS (e.g. AWS courses)
- My own experiments 

As there is a danger of this repository becoming very large over time, I am setting this up with [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). 

*"Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate."*
